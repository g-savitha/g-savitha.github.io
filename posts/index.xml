You cant afford paying bills for each and every project?
Well, Don&amp;rsquo;t worry now you can do that for free with the help of Github Pages. Using GH Pages you can host any website for free in a secured way.
When you host any static website or blog on github servers, basically your domain name would be in this format: {username}.github.io/{repo-name}, if you wish to host it on your own domain, no problem you can do that as well.</description></item><item><title>Syncing Git Fork with Original Repository</title><link>https://www.gsavitha.in/2020/syncing-git-fork-with-original-repository/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 11:30:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.gsavitha.in/2020/syncing-git-fork-with-original-repository/</guid><description>TL;DR 🚀 These are the only commands you need to sync your forked repo with the original repo

So: it’s risky to assume previous call has finished when you call it. Also, React will sometimes batch (squash together) calls to setState together into one for performance reasons. If a call to setState() depends on current state, the safest thing is to use the alternate “callback form”.
setState Callback Form this.setState(callback)
Instead of passing an object, pass it a callback with the current state as a parameter.</description></item><item><title>Build your own website in 10 min! with hugo</title><link>https://www.gsavitha.in/2020/build-your-own-website-in-10-min-with-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 14:58:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.gsavitha.in/2020/build-your-own-website-in-10-min-with-hugo/</guid><description>Wait, what?

Static site generators to the rescue Ok but first, what is a static site? 😕 Basically websites are of two types, static and dynamic.
