A static site as the name sounds it is - static, constant and fixed. It doesn&rsquo;t change dynamically when a developer makes a change to a file . They just create the static content(HTML and CSS) and upload them on to the server where it remains unchanged.</p><p>Where as dynamic sites are in almost constant state of change and are powered by servers or <a href=https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/>Content Management Systems(CMS)</a>. Server or CMS builds each page dynamically whenever a change occurs. When a URL is requested to fetch, CMS gets the appropriate data from the DB, loads on HTML, renders the content within template and returns formatted HTML to client&rsquo;s browser. This process is also known as <code>server side processing</code>.</p><h3 id=looks-like-cms-website-is-the-solution-then-why-ssg->Looks like CMS website is the solution, then why SSG? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3><p>Oh boy, you are a tough cookie. Lets see few of the disadvantages of CMS in brief.</p><ul><li>As CMS started growing popularity, CMS plugins or software have become more vulnerable to cyber attacks and this number is growing.</li><li>Performance issues. Obviously, because server is doing the more work. Page needs to be loaded each and every time a request is sent, whenever a user visits a site, backend code needs to startup, interact with DB, construct a HTTP response and send it back to server, after all this stuff is done, finally HTML file is returned to display the content.</li></ul><h3 id=ok-how-ssgs-helps-us>Ok, how SSGs helps us?</h3><p>Static site generators (SSGs) allow you to have a compromise between writing out a bunch of static html pages and using a potentially heavy (CMS) - retaining the benefits of both üòÆ . Cool right? SSGs give us a flexibility to write code dynamically and publish statically.</p><p>SSGs generates all the static pages of your site at once and deploys it to HTTP server.</p><h4 id=few-of-the-benefits-of-using-ssgs-in-brief>Few of the benefits of using SSGs in brief</h4><ul><li>Speed and performance.</li><li>Secured. Now we dont have the problems that come with CMS powered websites. Since static website is solely static files, they have no DB - no DB means no chance of getting hacked .</li><li>Improved cost and reliabilty. As we dont have a DB, we dont get connection errors like <code>failed to establish connection to DB</code> and also less maintenance costs as we dont have DB any more.</li></ul><h3 id=types-of-ssgs>Types of SSGs</h3><p>Now, lets look at some of the most popular options.</p><ul><li><a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> is a very popular SSG which claims itself as a fastest framework for building sites. It is written in <a href=https://golang.org/>Go</a></li><li><a href=https://nextjs.org/>Next.js</a> is a server-rendered framework developed on top of <a href=https://reactjs.org/>React</a>.</li><li><a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/>Gatsby.js</a> is built in React and uses <a href=https://graphql.org/>GraphQL</a> to manipulate data. It works great with documentation and blogs.</li><li><a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> is written using <a href=https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>Ruby</a>.</li></ul><p>Enough with words, Let&rsquo;s get started by building a site. Shall we?</p><h2 id=build-site-with-hugo>Build site with Hugo</h2><p>First things first&mldr;</p><h4 id=install-hugo>Install hugo</h4><p>To install hugo on linux(Ubuntu and Debian) from your terminal, run</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>sudo apt-get install hugo
<span class=ln>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For other platforms, check the <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/>official guide</a></p><h4 id=create-a-site>Create a site</h4><p>Once you install hugo, create a hugo site by running</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>hugo new site mywebsite
<span class=ln>2</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id=select-a-theme>Select a theme</h4><p>You need to pick a theme before starting. Wish there was some default theme to get started with. Anyways, there are lots of choices <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>over here</a>. I personally recommend to choose <a href=https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo>Minimo</a> as it is simple to get started with (You can tweak it later), and also i&rsquo;m a great fan of minimalism üòâ</p><h4 id=installing-the-theme>Installing the theme</h4><p>Basically you can install a theme in 3 ways.</p><ul><li>Download the zip file and unzip it manually in themes folder</li><li>As a git clone</li><li>As a git submodule.</li></ul><p>I recommend that you avoid the <code>git submodule</code> workflow they suggest on the page. You surely want to tweak the theme in future. Its best to have a repo for both the content and the theme same, as the deployment becomes easier (speaking out of personal experience üòÖ , this method gave me a nightmare üòì).</p><p>Ok jokes apart. You can download the zip and unzip it manually in the <code>themes/minimo</code> . This method doesn&rsquo;t work greatly all the time.</p><p>So I recommend to clone the repository. From your terminal run</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>git clone --depth <span class=m>1</span> https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo
</code></pre></div><p>For installation using other methods and also to tweak the website according to your needs. <a href=https://minimo.netlify.app/docs/installation/>Check out the official docs</a></p><p>Once you have cloned the repo, you need to configure the <code>config.toml</code> . As this is the file, which tells Hugo some details of the configuration to the website you created. So copy the <code>config.toml</code> from the theme whichever you have installed so that you dont accidentally change the theme&rsquo;s info. You can change the info from theme once you are familiar with hugo. If you are a beginner it is not recommended to do so.</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>cp themes/minimo/exampleSite/config.toml .
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it your website is created. Tweak the <code>config.toml</code> with your details and start using it. üòÉ</p><h4 id=add-content-and-start-the-server>Add content and start the server</h4><p>To start the server, run the following command in terminal</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>hugo serve -D
</code></pre></div><p><code>-D</code> command builds the static pages.</p><p>You can create a new post by creating a new <code>.md</code> file, prefixing it with your filename. To create some content run</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=ln>1</span>hugo new posts/firstpost.md
</code></pre></div><p>This posts folder automatically gets created in content folder. Edit this newly created file with your content</p><p>It will look something like this.</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-markdown data-lang=markdown><span class=ln>1</span>---
<span class=ln>2</span>title: &#34;First post&#34;
<span class=ln>3</span>date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
<span class=ln>4</span>draft: true
<span class=ln>5</span>---
</code></pre></div><h4 id=host-and-publish-the-site-on-your-custom-domain>Host and publish the site on your custom domain</h4><p>Once you have created your site. You can host it on github-pages or netlify or vercel or gitlab. My personal favourite is <code>github-pages</code>.</p><p>To know how to host it on gh-pages, refer this <a href=https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/>official doc</a>. By hosting the site on the respective platform, you will be given a default domain, you can use it or if you wish to have custom domain. Follow the below steps.</p><p>If you have hosted it on github pages.</p><ul><li>Go to your repository settings, under github pages, choose <code>gh-pages</code> branch as the source of your website. Under custom domain, add your own domain. Thats it your website is now live! üòç</li></ul><h4 id=few-resources-to-learn-hugo>Few resources to learn hugo</h4><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3">Giraffe Academy playlist on youtube</a></p><p><a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/>Official Hugo Docs</a></p><hr><p><a href=https://www.netguru.com/blog/what-are-static-site-generators>Learn more about SSGs here</a></p></div><div style=margin-top:2rem><i class="fas fa-tags" style=font-size:.7em;color:gray></i><a style="border:0;font-size:.8em;padding:0 4px;text-decoration:none" href=/tags/hugo>&nbsp;hugo</a>
